    To login, first click the **Sign in with Google** button and sign in to (or select) your UA account. 
    Please note that the only data used from your account is your UA username@alaska.edu email. This is 
    because we use your UA email to generate an account for you automatically. When using the UA 
    SSO authentication, a dummy password is used to ensure that your account can't be signed in to via the non-SSO
    option. Once you have finished getting your UA authentication, the **NEED GOOGLE SIGN-IN** button will update
    to **Continue** and will be activated.  Click that button to finish logging in.

    Please refresh your browser window if you do not see the **Sign in with Google** button or if you get a _419_ 
    error page.
