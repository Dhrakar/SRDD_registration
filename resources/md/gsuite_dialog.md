To login, first click the **Signin with Google** button and sign in to (or select) your UA account.  Please note that the only data used from your account is your UA username and @alaska.edu email.  This is because Factbook uses your UA email to generate an account for you automatically.  Since you are using the UA authentication, a dummy password is used to ensure that your account can't be used outside of the UA domain.  Once you have finished getting your UA authentication, the **Continue** button will be activated.  Click that button to finish logging in to Factbook.

_Note_ You are welcome to explore the Data and Dashboard modules without logging in (subject to the caveats in what is available to guests). Just click on the navigation links above to get started.
