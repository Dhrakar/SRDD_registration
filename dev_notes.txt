 - added a new tw-hidden.blade.php global components.  This is to house hidden versions of the color swatches
  (as well as future dialog divs).  The reason it is needed is that tailwinds prunes out CSS it does not think
  is used in the app.  Since it scans for css prior to the PHP vars being resolved, then it does not see them
  and they are not included.  Putting hidden swatches in forces tw to include those classes
- add todo file
- add deletion validation for tracks. This is partly based on the delete-profile file and usess alpine to 
  generate the dialog ( part of x-modal)
- created new views/components/srdd ( <x-srdd.callout> ) for building std intro, info card 
- needed to set the HOME in the RouteServiceProvider to '/' instead of dashboard
- lots of futzing with creating new form components
- finslly found the framework version in Illuminate\Foundation\Application.php
- once running, Laravel dumps any path info, so can't run composer, etc from within since it does not know php path

-- UA Google auth does not work currently -- maybe becaue this is not an SSL or valid web site?

- removed the themes for daisyui since tailwindcss supports dark mode jusrt fine when the OS switches.
 -- updated callout component to do dark mode
  text-slate-700 for light and text-slate-50 for dark

---- removed daisy completely since it was spewing links to itself all thru my page
- use text-std class for light/dark switching of text color 
- updated track and slot to use an intermediate for deletion
 -- The index calls 'delete' that gets sent to edit with a hidden $confirmation attribute.  If edit see that, it puts up a 
 confirmation form that, if accepted, routes to the actual destroy methos -- otherwise back to index

 ---- global views folder is for major nav and layout parts.  srdd is for components and widgets
  - for deleting objects, in order to pass the id filds, i needed to switch to having the delete done in the same index
  file as the list of objects.  So there is a form attached to teh trashbutton that sends a hidden 'CONFIRMED' input
  via get. If the index sees that value, it pops up a validation div that also has a from.  that form then submits to 
  the destroy method or cancels back (it also unsets the CONFIRMED)

- 2 dec
 -- added listeners for login/Logout so that the login count and last login can be updated
 -- created new helpers.php file for custom functions (and added to composer.json)
 -- rearranged the navigation and removed the user drop-down menu.  Also created a new nav-home page for those items
 like printing, etc that may need sub pages from home.

 - 7 Dec 
  -- prob fixed the logout problem... the form tag in the nav toolbar was not closed

- 8 Dec 
 -- date placed in .env as a mysql string.  to convert: 

   use Illuminate\Support\Carbon;
   Carbon::parse(env('SRD_DAY', now()))->toFormattedDateString();

   Change config to use mysql format date: 
    constant.php 'db_srdd_date' = Carbon::parse(env("SRD_DAY", now()))->format('Y-m-d')
    constant.php 'srdd_year' = Carbon::parse(env("SRD_DAY", now()))->format('Y')
-   config('constants.db_srdd_date')

- 10 Jan
 -- working on the print/email 
  -- created 2 files: sched and sched-text 

- 25 Jan 
 -- restart work on Auth ** GAUTH WILL ONLY WORK ON ONCILLA COPY
 -- Create new UserAuth middleware file
  -- already had the auth levels in constants.php
  -- add UserAUth to the Kernel.php aliases
 ? adding auth.level gives a 500 error ?
