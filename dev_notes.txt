 - added a new tw-hidden.blade.php global components.  This is to house hidden versions of the color swatches
  (as well as future dialog divs).  The reason it is needed is that tailwinds prunes out CSS it does not think
  is used in the app.  Since it scans for css prior to the PHP vars being resolved, then it does not see them
  and they are not included.  Putting hidden swatches in forces tw to include those classes
- add todo file
- add deletion validation for tracks. This is partly based on the delete-profile file and usess alpine to 
  generate the dialog ( part of x-modal)
- created new views/components/srdd ( <x-srdd.callout> ) for building std intro, info card
